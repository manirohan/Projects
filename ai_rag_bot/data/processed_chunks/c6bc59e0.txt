improvements on image tasks. Masking User Prompts Drawing on techniques from Allal et al. (2025), we explore user-prompt masking during supervised fine-tuning as a way to reduce overfitting. The right violin plot in Figure 6 shows that masking user queries (orange) yields improved performance in both image and video tasks, compared to the unmasked baseline (blue). This effect is significantly pronounced in multimodal QA, where questions are often repetitive and can be trivially memorized by the model. Masking thus forces SmolVLM to rely on task-related content rather than superficial repetition, promoting better generalization. Finding 6. System prompts and media intro/outro tokens significantly improve compact VLM perfor- mance, particularly for video tasks. During SFT, only train on completions. 3.3 Impact of Text Data Reuse from LLM-SFT A seemingly intuitive practice is to reuse text data from the final supervised fine-tuning stages of large language models, anticipating in-distribution prompts and higher-quality linguistic inputs. However, Figure 7 (left) shows that incorporating LLM-SFT text data ( SmolTalk ) can degrade performance in smaller multimodal architectures by as much as 3.7% in video tasks and 6.5% in image tasks. We attribute this negative transfer to reduced data diversity, which outweighs any benefits of reusing text. In keeping with Zohar et al. (2024b), we therefore maintain a strict 14% text proportion in our training mix. These findings highlight the importance of a carefully balanced data pipeline, rather than direct adoption of large-scale SFT text for small-scale multimodal models. Finding 7. Adding text from SFT blend proved worse than new text SFT data. 3.4 Optimizing Chain-of-Thought Integration for Compact Models Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, which exposes models to explicit reasoning steps during training, generally enhances reasoning capabilities in large models. However, its effect on smaller multimodal architectures remains unclear. To investigate this, we varied the proportion of CoT
