et al., 2024). The text samples were sourced from (Xu et al., 2024). For a more granular description, Figure 8 provides a detailed overview of the training data distribution used in both our vision and video fine-tuning stages. 4.2 Evaluation details We evaluated SmolVLM using VLMEvalKit (Duan et al., 2024) to ensure reproducibility. The full results are available online1. Currently, the OpenVLM Leaderboard covers 239different VLMs and 31different multi-modal benchmarks. Further, we plot the performance against the RAM required to run the evaluations. We argue that model size is usually used as a proxy for the computational cost required to run a model. This is misleading for VLMs because the architecture strongly influences how expensive it is to run the model; in our opinion, RAM usage is a better proxy. For SmolVLM, this resizes the longest edge of images to 1920in the256M and 500M models and 1536in the 2.2B. 4.3 Strong Performance at a Tiny Scale We evaluate SmolVLMâ€™s performance relative to model size, comparing three variants ( 256M,500M, and 2.2B) against efficient state-of-the-art open-source models. Table 1 summarizes results across nine demanding vision-language benchmarks and five video benchmarks.
