Universal lesion detection and tagging (ULDT) in CT studies is critical for tumor burden assessment and tracking the progression of lesion status (growth/shrinkage) over time. However, a lack of fully annotated data hinders the development of effective ULDT approaches. Prior work used the DeepLesion dataset (4,427 patients, 10,594 studies, 32,120 CT slices, 32,735 lesions, 8 body part labels) for algorithmic development, but this dataset is not completely annotated and contains class imbalances. To address these issues, in this work, we developed a self-training pipeline for ULDT. A VFNet model was trained on a limited 11.5\% subset of DeepLesion (bounding boxes + tags) to detect and classify lesions in CT studies. Then, it identified and incorporated novel lesion candidates from a larger unseen data subset into its training set, and self-trained itself over multiple rounds. Multiple self-training experiments were conducted with different threshold policies to select predicted lesions with higher quality and cover the class imbalances. We discovered that direct self-training improved the sensitivities of over-represented lesion classes at the expense of under-represented classes. However, upsampling the lesions mined during self-training along with a variable threshold policy yielded a 6.5\% increase in sensitivity at 4 FP in contrast to self-training without class balancing (72\% vs 78.5\%) and a 11.7\% increase compared to the same self-training policy without upsampling (66.8\% vs 78.5\%). Furthermore, we show that our results either improved or maintained the sensitivity at 4FP for all 8 lesion classes.
