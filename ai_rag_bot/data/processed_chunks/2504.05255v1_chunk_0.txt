Regarding the representation theorem of Kolmogorov and Arnold (KA) as an algorithm for representing or {\guillemotleft}expressing{\guillemotright} functions, we test its robustness by analyzing its ability to withstand adversarial attacks. We find KA to be robust to countable collections of continuous adversaries, but unearth a question about the equi-continuity of the outer functions that, so far, obstructs taking limits and defeating continuous groups of adversaries. This question on the regularity of the outer functions is relevant to the debate over the applicability of KA to the general theory of NNs.
