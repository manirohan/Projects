  "title": "SmolVLM: Redefining small and efficient multimodal models",
  "abstract": "Large Vision-Language Models (VLMs) deliver exceptional performance but\nrequire significant computational resources, limiting their deployment on\nmobile and edge devices. Smaller VLMs typically mirror design choices of larger\nmodels, such as extensive image tokenization, leading to inefficient GPU memory\nusage and constrained practicality for on-device applications.\n  We introduce SmolVLM, a series of compact multimodal models specifically\nengineered for resource-efficient inference. We systematically explore\narchitectural configurations, tokenization strategies, and data curation\noptimized for low computational overhead. Through this, we identify key design\nchoices that yield substantial performance gains on image and video tasks with\nminimal memory footprints.\n  Our smallest model, SmolVLM-256M, uses less than 1GB GPU memory during\ninference and outperforms the 300-times larger Idefics-80B model, despite an\n18-month development gap. Our largest model, at 2.2B parameters, rivals\nstate-of-the-art VLMs consuming twice the GPU memory. SmolVLM models extend\nbeyond static images, demonstrating robust video comprehension capabilities.\n  Our results emphasize that strategic architectural optimizations, aggressive\nyet efficient tokenization, and carefully curated training data significantly\nenhance multimodal performance, facilitating practical, energy-efficient\ndeployments at significantly smaller scales.",
