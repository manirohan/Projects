  "title": "Evaluating Knowledge Graph Based Retrieval Augmented Generation Methods\n  under Knowledge Incompleteness",
  "abstract": "Knowledge Graph based Retrieval-Augmented Generation (KG-RAG) is a technique\nthat enhances Large Language Model (LLM) inference in tasks like Question\nAnswering (QA) by retrieving relevant information from knowledge graphs (KGs).\nHowever, real-world KGs are often incomplete, meaning that essential\ninformation for answering questions may be missing. Existing benchmarks do not\nadequately capture the impact of KG incompleteness on KG-RAG performance. In\nthis paper, we systematically evaluate KG-RAG methods under incomplete KGs by\nremoving triples using different methods and analyzing the resulting effects.\nWe demonstrate that KG-RAG methods are sensitive to KG incompleteness,\nhighlighting the need for more robust approaches in realistic settings.",
